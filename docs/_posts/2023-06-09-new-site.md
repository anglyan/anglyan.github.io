I have undergone a few updates:

- I have changed the Jekyll template and the site
- I have changed how the site is hosted
- I have added a static blog feature

The main motivation behind this change is that I was looking
for a way of making the site more dynamic without fully switching
to a blog format. I also like the static nature of Jekyll.
