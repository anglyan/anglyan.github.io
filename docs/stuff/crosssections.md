# Argon cross sections for electron impact processes

The cross sections included in this set are based on experimental
measurements both by electron beam and optical methods. It is the first
set that was able to model the excitation and Townsend coefficients for
Ar without any fitting parameter. Further information can be found on
the following paper:

Two files are provided: one containing the level description and the
second one with the momentum transfer, excitation and ionization cross
sections.
