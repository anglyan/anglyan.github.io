# Atomic layer deposition

Atomic layer deposition is an awesome materials synthesis technique that
allows you to synthesize materials as thin films atomic layer by atomic
layer. You can find my up goer-five explanation of ALD
[here](/stuff/upgoer.html) or, for a
more reputable source, you can check
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_layer_deposition).

Based on the sequential exposure of two or more gaseous species the
formation of the material, ALD is a time-dependent process. At each
cycle, the fraction of the surface covered with adsorbed precursor
molecules increases with time until, if you wait for long enough,
everything is coated by a monolayer of adsorbed precursor molecules.
Therefore, in contrast to other thin film deposition techniques like
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtering, which are sort of
steady-state processes, ALD is driven by the saturation dynamics coupled
to precursor transport: the evolution of surface coverage in time AND
space.

Two key characteristics of ALD that make it particularly interesting
are:

-   It is extremely reproducible: this makes it an ideal model system to
    study the impact of surface kinetics on the microstructure and
    properties of materials.
-   It is extremely conformal and scalable: its ability to homogeneously
    coat high surface area materials makes it a very useful tool in the
    fabrication of complex nanomaterials.

My research focuses on the application of ALD to the design of new
materials and on its use as a sandbox to understand materials growth.
