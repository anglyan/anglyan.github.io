I am a physicist / materials scientist, currently a staff scientist at
[Argonne National
Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/angel-yanguasgil)'s
Applied Materials Division, and a Fellow at Northwestern Argonne
Institute for Science and Engineering at Northwestern University.

My current research focuses on the following areas:

-   The [physics and chemistry of growth](research/growth.html), 
    and the  relationship between surface kinetics,
    structure, and properties of materials. Basically how stuff is made
    (and unmade), from fundamental physics to manufacturing. My research
    in this area leverages both simulations, 
    machine learning, and in-situ characterizationm to explore
    fundamental questions, accelerate discovery
    and its transition to manufacturing. I have focused primarily on
    atomic layer deposition, a thin film growth technique that is
    widely used in microelectronics and for energy applications.
-   [Neuromorphic computing](research/neuro.html), or
    brain-inspired computing, both at the architecture/computational and
    the implementation/materials level. In particular I am interested in
    exploring novel architectures capable of learning in real time, processing
    data really fast, and computing under resource-constrained scenarios.
    In my research, I have used primarily the insect brain as a source of
    inspiration, exploring both novel algorithms and their implementation
    for AI at the edge and a new generation of detectors.
-   [Electronic materials](research/electronic.html),
    and the way their properties can be leveraged to fabricate novel
    devices in microelectronics, power electronics, RF, and quantum
    computing applications. In particular, I am interested in how to
    enable sensing and computing under extreme environments, and the
    development of co-design approaches that bridge from materials
    to applications.

During my PhD and postdoctoral research I also developed some serious
expertise in the following areas:

-   Plasma physics and plasma kinetics. My first love. Bringer of twisty
    magnetic lines and reactive noble gas atoms. Killer of surfaces and
    enabler of computer chips. I am currently part of project looking
    at plasma processing for decarbonization.
-   The interaction and scattering of electromagnetic fields and in
    particular light with matter, including spectroscopic ellipsometry
    and metamaterials.

I am a strong advocate of open source software. It features strongly in my work
and I have developed and released as open source a number of tools for scientific
and machine learning applications. Check my [github profile](https://github.com/anglyan).
