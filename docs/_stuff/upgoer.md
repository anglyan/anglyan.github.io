# Up-goer five description of atomic layer deposition

[This xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1133/) describes a Saturn V using only
the ten hundred most commonly used words. And
[this](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) is an editor that helps you
write stuff using only those words. This is my attempt at describing
Atomic Layer Deposition:

> I grow stuff layer by layer using tiny things that fly through the air
> and that break down when they touch the stuff I am growing. As they
> break they form a layer until they don't break anymore. But then I use
> a kind of air that changes my stuff and lets me start all over again
> and add a second layer. By repeating this many times, I can get to
> grow thicker stuff. I grow my stuff inside a sort of can that keeps me
> from breathing the things I use because they could kill me or make me
> sick. The stuff that I grow can be used to make computers or get power
> from the sun.
